You will depart the estate for a partial loop on the world-famous North Coast 500, Scotland’s answer to Route 66.

These remote, challenging and beautiful ranges, offer unparalleled views of the dreamy Highlands.

On the final morning, you will be invited to the front lawns of the castle for a special falconry display.
