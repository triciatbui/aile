			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top">
				<p class="leading">I love my hubby...we definitely aren’t perfect and I think we have a pretty good relationship. We work hard on figuring out the best ways to communicate because we’re two very different people that process two very different ways. It did get harder once our little one was in the picture but it’s stronger now. Being tired became our new normal and we just go along with our daily life. Jacob works and I take care of Adeline at home - eat, sleep, and repeat. For us, tensions have festered if we didn’t (and sometimes did) address an annoyance or a grievance. In the end, our arguments have helped us become more intimate because it forced us to really listen and communicate. We try not to neglect each other emotionally and physically by checking in and taking opportunities for quality time with just the two of us.</p>

				<p class="leading question bold">Have you had to cut back on spending? Where did you cut?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top">
				<p class="leading">Yes, shopping! Before getting married and having a baby, I really enjoyed my occasional shopping sprees for clothes. Whether it was for an event or running out of clean laundry, it was so easy just to say, “Oh, I can just go buy [said item]”. Ah, but that was back in college and the first 2 years of marriage while I was working part-time and full-time, respectively. This mind set is quite different now that I’m a stay-at-home-mom with a toddler. Instead of shopping for myself on the whim or a want, I’m much more thoughtful and shop on a need. Especially with my daughter because it’s crazy how fast babies grow! Even though I’ve “cut back” on shopping, it doesn’t seem that terrible an adjustment because I really enjoy shopping for my daughter and finding great deals! It’s so satisfying and my working hubby appreciates it too.</p>

				<p class="leading question bold">Do you fight about money more than you did before?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top">
				<p class="leading">My husband and I actually fought more about money in our newlywed year when we both worked full-time rather than now on a single income. Our personalities are total opposites but somehow we’ve learn to balance each other out pretty well. My husband Jacob, is a saver and very practical; whereas I am much more free spirited with money. We weren’t on the same page about financial responsibility/peace and this was where tensions stemmed from. What really helped our communication was taking Dave Ramsey’s Financial Peace University seminars together. The classes gave us tools and insight to get on the same page regarding finances and financial peace. Each class was only 2 hours long, once a week for 9 weeks - which was such a fun way for us to spend time together away from our baby. Going to these sessions really brought us closer and we could essentially speak the same language on how to budget, save, invest, give, and spend money.</p>

				<p class="leading question bold">Are you resentful of your working spouse?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top small-padding-bottom">
				<p class="leading">No...I wouldn’t say I’m resentful of Jacob and I am definitely grateful that he is able to work and provide for our family. I think it’s a real blessing that we are able to live on a single income because I know that he works very hard. Sometimes I think he works a little too much and seems too busy to help care for our daughter while he is at home. Or maybe he’s too tired...which makes me feel guilty or annoyed at times. He’s the type of person that loves to keep busy and keep learning; which is great but we’re still figuring it out and trying our best. Despite those fleeting feelings, I have much appreciation for my husband because he is a wonderful dad. I would love to experience an alternate reality where Jacob and I switch roles and he can be the stay-at-home parent. I think it would be so fun!</p>

				<p class="leading question bold">What did you find is your biggest struggle as a mom?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top small-padding-bottom">
				<p class="leading">I think my biggest struggle as a mom is patience. Patience to know that not everything with your little one is an instantaneous fix, adjustment, or instantly picked up. I get easily frustrated at times and am constantly trying to remind myself that things take time to develop and that I need to be a good example and model for my daughter. I’m her first and most important teacher after all. My Mother-in-law practices meditation and I feel like I need to start so I can find some zen.</p>

				<p class="leading question bold">What are the top 3 things you do to help nurture your relationship with Adeline?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top small-padding-bottom">
				<p class="leading">Three activities I do with Adeline are: praying, singing/dancing, and potty training.  Praying as a family each night is a great way for us to give thanks together for all our blessings, for our day, and for a good night’s rest. My husband and I want Adeline to be comfortable actively praying aloud and it’s an activity for us to close out our day as a family.<br><br>Adeline and I both love music and dancing. We sing in English and Vietnamese so she gets exposed to both languages. It’s so fun to share my favorite childhood songs and lullabies as well as learning new favorites together. It’s great that these songs also have fun movements to go along with them to help her become more aware of her own body.<br><br>It sounds ridiculous, but we actually started potty training Adeline when she was only 3 months old. My mom, who was born in Vietnam, is a firm believer of potty training early. In the countryside of Vietnam, it is the norm to potty train early since the convenience of diapers were not available. The technique is quite simple and a bit time consuming, but it works! We train the baby by triggering and associating the /s/ sound with going to the bathroom. Adeline has learned to communicate with me by letting me know when she needs to go potty by using this sound. Of course there are the occasional accidents but we’re always so impressed how long she can hold sometimes and it’s great!</p>

				<p class="leading question bold">So far, what’s your biggest mom takeaway?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top small-padding-bottom">
				<p class="leading">A takeaway that comes to mind is not to be afraid to take your little one out to new and different places. Of course everyone needs to do this with their own and little one’s personal comfort levels. With little Adeline, we always took her out on different daily or weekly activities despite her young age. She was only three days old when we first took her to weekly mass and partied till late at a family wedding at two months old. We even take her on errands and out to restaurants.  It’s been a great delight to have her experience these activities for her social development. She’s a great little world traveler to my surprising relief and loves flying. She understands and learns very quickly what is acceptable and what is not. It gives me confidence that she can listen and follow my lead when we’re out and about. It’s so clear that these all help her build strong social skills and awareness.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top small-padding-bottom">
				<p class="leading">One of Adeline’s favorite activities is eating. She loves to eat and has been very independent about feeding herself at an early age. I take this opportunity to introduce her to new foods and techniques to eat. Adeline has a fairly focused attention span and this trait has helped her fine motor skills in a big way. She has developed a strong hold and control of utensils and this translates well when she draws. After she eats, I ask her to take her dishware to the sink for washing. I then help her wash her own dishes and put them away in their proper place. I think this will be a great way for her to learn to clean up after herself.</p>

				<p class="leading question bold">How have you grown as a person after becoming a mom?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cell six center ten small-padding-top small-padding-bottom">
				<p class="leading">I always want to be able to continue to grow and learn no matter how old I get, and becoming a mom has definitely given me the opportunity to grow more quickly. For example, I’m a terrible cook! Growing up I didn’t have much interest in it since my family members are great cooks. My role was more clean up crew than chef because they were the cooks, so why mess up a good flow, right? But as a mom now, I really want to be able to cook and cook well. I believe that food is central for a home because that’s what brings people together. I don’t have everything perfectly figured out yet but the motivation is there. There’s still hope for me!</p>
